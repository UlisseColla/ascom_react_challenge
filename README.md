# ASCOM challenge

Once you cloned the project, enter the repository and install the node modules.
``` bash
cd ASCOM_challenge/ascom_challenge/
npm install
```

Then run: 
``` bash
npm run dev
```
to run it locally on your browser.

The App fetches the data coming from the API https://mobile.digistat.it/CandidateApi/, instead of fetching data from a JSON file like for level 1 and 2 of the challenge.
